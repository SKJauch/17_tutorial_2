# Regex Tutorial-Validating Emails

Regular Expressions (regex) are a specific sequence of characters, including letters, numbers and special characters, that can be included in search algorithm code to find or find and replace characters that are in a string or to validate input from users.  

## Summary

Regex can be used to search for text that is in a string but it can also verify whether or not a user has entered information correctly in a form.  In the case of verifying an email, regex can be made to be more specific by adding rules to the string search to ensure that the the structure of an email has been entered.  This can be done with only a few lines of code.  While this can be useful, it is important to understand that regex will not verify that an email is valid, but it will confirm if a user has entered characters into an email format.  This could add to the user experience by not accepting an email that does not meet criteria of a valid email address.  However, if not coded properly, it could invalidate or not accept international emails which could detract from the user experience.

In JavaScript the code could look like this:  

function ValidateEmail(inputText)
{
    var mailformat = /^[a-zA-Z0-9.!#$%&â€™*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+(?:\.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)*$/
    if(inputText.value.match(mailformat))
    {
        alert("Please enter a valid email address");
        return false;
        }
}

## Regex Components

### Anchors

Search parameters are anchored by ^ or $ which tells the code to look for the characters after the ^ or before the $. 

### Quantifiers

A quantifier tells the code how many characters or symbols must be present to be a successful match.  For example, (+) means that the character matches at least once while (?) is expecting the character to match exactly zero times or one time.

### OR Operator

An OR operator tells the code that it can look for more than one condition.  This could be helpful when considering international email addresses (.com in the US OR .uk in UK)
